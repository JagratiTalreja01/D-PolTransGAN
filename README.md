# D-PolTransGAN: Scattering Guided Hybrid Transformer-GAN for SAR-Optical Image Translation using Dual Polarization SAR  
D-PolTransGAN is a deep learning framework for translating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery into perceptually realistic optical imagery using dual polarization inputs (VV &amp; VH) via local cross-attention fusion, and a Transformer-based generator within a GAN setup to capture complementary scattering patterns. 


The code is built on [MT_GAN (PyTorch)](https://github.com/NUAA-RS/MT_GAN) and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.6 environment (Python 3.10.13, PyTorch >= 1.1.0) with NVIDIA RTX A4000 with 16GB RAM.

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of D-PolTransGAN:, a dual-band SAR-to-Optical translation framework designed for flood assessment. The architecture introduces dual-stem processing for Sentinel-1 VV and VH polarizations, followed by Scattering-Guided Attention Fusion (SGAF) to exploit their complementary scattering properties. To balance local spatial detail and global contextual modeling, the network integrates CNN backbones with Transformer modules inside a GAN framework, enhanced by SE-gated skip connections.

Trained on the DeepFlood dataset, BiSARFormerGAN generates optical-like imagery that preserves fine-grained structures, improves perceptual quality, and supports reliable flood mapping and disaster response.

## Key Highlights:

 * Dual-Polarization Processing: Independent stems for SAR VV and VH bands, extracting complementary scattering features.

 * Scattering-Guided Attention Fusion (SGAF): Adaptive fusion mechanism that leverages interactions between VV and VH polarizations for richer representation.

 * Hybrid GAN–Transformer Framework: Combines the perceptual realism of GANs with the global contextual modeling power of Transformers.

 * SE-Gated Skip Connections: Noise-aware skip links that selectively pass useful features while suppressing SAR-induced artifacts.

 * Efficient and Stable Training: Incorporates Residual Swin Transformer Blocks and multi-loss optimization (L1, SSIM, perceptual, adversarial) for balanced realism and accuracy.

 * Superior Performance: Outperforms state-of-the-art SAR-to-Optical translation models on the DeepFlood dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while producing interpretable optical-like outputs for real flood events.

 * D-PolTransGAN bridges SAR and optical modalities, improving the usability of SAR imagery for flood mapping, disaster response, and geospatial analysis.
